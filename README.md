## ✨ Why Use Ai-Buble-Loader?

In 2025, everyone is building AI apps — but most still use *90’s-era* spinners and plain “loading…” text.  
The waiting experience is part of your product. **Ai-Buble-Loader** brings your app to life with  
a fun, modern, and *AI-inspired color scheme* that sparks curiosity and engagement.

Instead of making users wonder *“How long will this take?”*,  
make them say *“Wow, this looks cool!”* 🤩
